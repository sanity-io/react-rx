# Reactive components

## Intro

A _reactive component_ is a React component that turns an observable of props into an observable of [values React can render](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#render) (e.g. element, strings, fragments)

A _reactive component_ enables you to create components that composes different RxJS streams into a single render function, making your view purely a function of state and providing an explicit dataflow that's easier to reason about.

The `rxComponent()` utility wraps a function component that is very similar to a regular React function component, with two notable differences:

1. Instead of being called with a _props object_, it is called with an _Observable of props_
2. Instead of returning _renderable values_, it returns an _Observable of renderable values_

Here's an example component that fetches some text from the url passed as the `url` prop:

```jsx
import * as ReactRx from 'react-rx'

const Fetch = ReactRx.component((props$) =>
  props$.pipe(
    switchMap((props) => fetch(props.url).then((response) => response.text())),
    map((responseText) => <>Response is {responseText}</>)
  )
)

// Usage
ReactDOM.render(<Fetch url="/some/url" />, container)
```

Instead of a _function_, `rxComponent` can also take an `Observable` as argument as long as it's an observable of [something React can render](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#render). This is neat when you have component that doesn't take any props, but still depends on values coming from an `Observable`:

```jsx
import * as ReactRx from 'react-rx'

const Counter = ReactRx.component(
  timer(0, 100).pipe(map((counter) => <>The number is {counter}</>))
)

ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, container)
```

## Local component state

Instead of calling `React.useState()` directly, you can also use the `useState` function exported from this package. Instead of the actual state value it will return an observable representing the state changes, along with a function to update it. Here's the example above rewritten to use `useState` from this package instead.

```jsx{4}
import {rxComponent, useState} from 'react-rx'

const Counter = rxComponent(() => {
  const [count$, setCount] = useState(0)

  return count$.pipe(
    map((currentCount) => (
      <>
        <div>Click count: {currentCount}</div>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(currentCount + 1)}>Click!</button>
      </>
    ))
  )
})
```

## Responding to events

Sometimes your state comes as a function of an event triggered by the user. Let's say you want to display the mouse cursors x,y position as the user moves the mouse inside a component. This can be done by using the `useEvent()` utility:

```js{4}
import {useEvent, rxComponent} from 'react-rx'

const MouseTracker = rxComponent(() => {
  const [mouseMove$, handleMouseMove] = event()

  return mouseMove$.pipe(
    map((event) => (
      <>
        <div onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>Hover me!</div>
        <pre>
          x={event.screenX},y={event.screenY}
        </pre>
      </>
    ))
  )
})
```

### Gotcha: Initial render

The above example will not produce any DOM before a mousemove event has been triggered, and the mouse event can't be triggered before the DOM has been rendered, which puts us in a catch-22 situation. To cope with it, we can make the observable start by emitting an initial value for the event.

We can do this by using the `startWith` operator that comes with RxJS:

```js{8}
import {rxComponent, useEvent} from 'react-rx'
import {map, startWith} from 'rxjs/operators'

const MouseTracker = rxComponent(() => {
  const [mouseMove$, handleMouseMove] = useEvent()

  return mouseMove$.pipe(
    startWith(null),
    map((event) => (
      <>
        <div onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>Hover me!</div>
        {event && (
          <pre>
            x={event.screenX},y={event.screenY}
          </pre>
        )}
      </>
    ))
  )
})
```

This means the `event` argument now can also be `null` so we also need to guard about that in our render function.

## Consuming React hooks

Reactive components will not automatically re-render when a `useState()` value updates. In order to respond to state updates from React hooks, the value needs to be converted to an observable. This is done by wrapping it using the `toObservable()` utility before combining it with the returned observable. Here's an example:

```jsx{4}
import {rxComponent} from 'react-rx

const Counter = rxComponent(props$ => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)

  return toObservable(count).pipe(
    map(currentCount => (
      <>
        <div>Click count: {currentCount}</div>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(currentCount + 1)}>Click!</button>
      </>
    )))
})
```

The `toObservable` function makes it possible to consume community provided React hooks inside a reactive component. However, this package also export some utility functions that wraps regular hooks so you can use them with less boilerplate, for example, the `ReactRx.useState` function described above.

### React ecosystem interop

Using `reactiveComponent` in a project with regular react components or components installed from the React ecosystem just works. Although it's advisable to not consume React hooks inside a `reactiveComponent`, but it's still possible by turning a value into an observable with `useAsObservable`. Here's an example:

```tsx
import {useAsObservable, rxComponent} from 'react-rx

function useClickCounter(): [number, () => void] {
  const [clickCount, setClickCount] = React.useState(0)
  const inc = React.useCallback(() => setClickCount((c) => c + 1), [])

  return [clickCount, inc]
}

const HooksInteropExample = rxComponent(() => {
  const [clickCount, inc] = useClickCounter()

  // This is required in order to turn clickCount into an observable value
  const click$ = useAsObservable(clickCount)

  return click$.pipe(
    map((clickCount) => (
      <button onClick={inc}>
        This button has been clicked {clickCount} times
      </button>
    ))
  )
})
```

# Observable Hooks

## useObservable()

Use observables in React components with the `useObservable` hook.

If you need to subscribe to an observable in your component, this hook will give you the current value from it

Example:

```jsx
import {useObservable} from 'react-rx'
import {interval} from 'rxjs'

function MyComponent(props) {
  const number = useObservable(interval(100), 0)

  return <>The number is {number}</>
}
```

The `initialValue` argument is optional. If its omitted, the value returned from `useObservable` may be `null` initially. If the observable emits a value _synchronously_ at subscription time, that value will be used as the initial value, and any `initialValue` passed as argument to `useObservable` will be ignored:

```jsx
import {of} from 'rxjs'
import {useObservable} from 'react-rx'

// This component will never render "Hello mars!" since the observable emits "world" synchronously.
function MyComponent(props) {
  const planet = useObservable(of('world'), 'mars')

  return <>Hello {planet}!</>
}
```

## useObservableState()

If you need to represent some piece of state as an observable and also want the ability to change this state during the lifetime of the component, `useObservableState` is for you. It acts like `React.useState()`, only that it returns an observable representing changes to the value instead of the value itself. The callback/setter returned acts like a the regular callback you would otherwise get from `React.useState`. This is useful when you want to compose the state change together with other observables.

Note: this is exact same hook as the `useState()` function described in the section about Reactive Component above, it's only been exported under a different and more explicit name to distinguish better from `React.useState()`.

Here's an example of a component that count numbers at a certain speed, allowing the user to adjust the counting speed by adjusting a slider:

```jsx
import {useObservableState} from 'react-rx'

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [speed$, setSpeed] = useObservableState(1)

  const count$ = speed$.pipe(
    switchMap((speed) => timer(0, 1000 / speed)),
    scan((count) => count + 1, 0)
  )

  const currentSpeed = useObservable(speed$)
  const currentCount = useObservable(count$)

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Counter value: {currentCount}</div>
      <div>Counting speed: {Math.round((1 / currentSpeed) * 100) / 100}s</div>
      <input
        type="range"
        value={currentSpeed}
        min={1}
        max={10}
        onChange={(event) => setSpeed(Number(event.currentTarget.value))}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## useObservableEvent()

This creates an event handler and an observable that represents calls to that handler.

Here's an example of a component thad displays the current value from a range input:

```jsx
import {useObservableEvent} from 'react-rx'

const ShowSliderValue = () => {
  const [onSliderChange$, onSliderChange] = useObservableEvent()

  const sliderValue = useObservable(
    onSliderChange$.pipe(
      map((event) => event.currentTarget.value),
      map((value) => Number(value)),
      startWith(1)
    )
  )

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="range"
        value={sliderValue}
        min={1}
        max={10}
        onChange={onSliderChange}
      />
      <div>Value is: {sliderValue}</div>
    </>
  )
}
```
